2013.04.30  I refresh the psql (postgresql) munin plugins, it tested on squeeze.

            I merge the old lenny dir to squeze.

            I commit mitty fixes to my squeeze dir.
                        
            Thanks for new lxc plugin - lxc_net 
            
            This plugin reads a "lxc.network.veth.pair" setting from "config" file of each container,
            because lxc-start command creates a random named veth device without the setting.
            
            If the xen config (/var/lib/lxc/GUEST_NAME/config does not contain this parameter,.
            then you have to fill it, becouse if every guest restart generate new device name, then the graph will be useless
            ( example config : lxc.network.veth.pair = vethsamba )
            
            
2013.04.29  Unfortunately I haven't got much enough time to work with this project to be much better now.
